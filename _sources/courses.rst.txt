Courses
=======

The VM combines various software packages, course materials and sample data.

The courses are based on `IPython notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_.
The material has been evolving since the very first "Open Source Radar Short Course" at
`ERAD 2014 <http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/erad2014/>`_. Since then, several courses
have been carried out at ERAD and AMS meeting as well as other occasions.

See :doc:`here <quickstart>` how to start a ``jupyter`` server and access the course material on the VM.

You can also access the repositories with course materials directly:

* `Py-ART course <https://github.com/openradar/AMS-Short-Course-on-Open-Source-Radar-Software>`_
